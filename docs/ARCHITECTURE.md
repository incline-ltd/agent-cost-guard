# Architecture

`agent-cost-guard` is intentionally one small Node.js and TypeScript package.
It has no server, database, account, telemetry, LLM, or runtime dependency.

## Why this shape fits

The tool sits between a coding agent and a proposed action. Its job is narrow:
inspect untrusted data, apply deterministic cost rules, and return a decision
before the host decides whether the action may run.

Keeping that path local and direct makes the important properties easy to
audit:

- inspected commands are never executed, sourced, evaluated, or expanded;
- rules produce the same result for the same input;
- possible credentials are redacted before output;
- an `allow` result never overrides the host's permission system; and
- no inspection needs a network connection or account.

## Data flow

```text
CLI, TypeScript caller, or host hook
  -> validate the external payload
  -> normalize shell, tool, or file-change input
  -> tokenize supported shell syntax without executing it
  -> match deterministic JSON rules
  -> order block and approval matches
  -> redact evidence
  -> emit the CLI or host-protocol decision
```

## Boundaries

### Adapters

Adapters understand host-specific JSON. They must reject malformed supported
actions in strict mode and must never turn a core `allow` into automatic host
approval.

The adapter layer stays deliberately small. Claude Code and interactive GitHub
Copilot can map a cost match to the host's `ask` decision. Codex and Cursor do
not currently provide a reliable interactive prompt decision, so their adapters
map both `approval-required` and `block` to `deny` with the complete redacted
approval details. On a no-match, Cursor returns neutral `{}` and the other
adapters emit no permission override.

Agents without a first-class adapter use the same core through `inspect-json`
with `source: "generic"`. Enforcement still requires a before-tool hook or a
wrapper that can stop the proposed action; the core cannot intercept tools by
itself.

### Core

The core owns deterministic inspection. It reports whether parsing was
complete so an adapter can distinguish a genuine no-match from input it could
not safely inspect.

### Rules

Rules stay under `rules/` with stable IDs. A rule describes a cost policy, not
general command security. Every rule needs positive, negative, near-match, and
redaction coverage.

### Output

Output contains redacted structural evidence only. A compound action must list
every distinct cost approval it requires.

CLI and hook stdin is capped at 1 MiB. Oversized generic JSON is rejected, and
strict host hooks convert oversized input into the host's native deny response.

## Deliberate non-goals

- calculating a full cloud bill;
- querying live cloud accounts or prices;
- replacing IAM, budgets, sandboxes, or native agent permissions;
- parsing every possible shell program;
- becoming a broad command-security scanner; or
- adding a web application or remote policy service.
